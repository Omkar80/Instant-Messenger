# Instant-Messenger
This is a basic messenger created purely in java which allows to communicate between a server and a client just as other messenger apps like whatsapp and instagram.
To access this, first download the repository and extract all the files.

Then in the ClientTest.java replace the server address 127.0.0.1 with your server host or virtual private server.

Then compile both the files. Uplaod the serverside files on the server and run the ServerTest.java file then ClientTest.java and then the connection will be established. Enjoy!

If you don't have any server then you can run the ServerTest.java and then ClientTest.java and then the connection will be established in the same machine without making any changes mentioned. 127.0.0.1 is a local host and you can run both the server and client on the same machine just for testing.
It has a client limit of 100.
